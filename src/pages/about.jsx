    bio: "Purbasha Tripura is the official handicrafts brand of the Government of Tripura, dedicated to preserving and promoting the state's rich artisanal heritage. With a diverse collection that spans handloom textiles, bamboo and cane products, traditional jewelry, and ethnic pickles (achaar), Purbasha represents the heart of Tripura's cultural identity. Every product sold under Purbasha is handcrafted by local artisans, many of whom are part of Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and tribal communities, ensuring both authenticity and social impact. With over 6 stores across India, Purbasha connects artisans to markets while supporting sustainable rural livelihoods.",
    story:
      "Purbasha was established in 1974 as an initiative by the Tripura Handicrafts Development Corporation Ltd. to showcase and support the indigenous crafts of Tripura. In the early days, artisans from remote tribal areas had little access to fair trade opportunities. Purbasha became a bridge between their craft and the broader national market. Over the years, it has evolved into a symbol of tradition, empowerment, and craftsmanship. Whether it's a handloom woven Rignai or a finely carved bamboo lamp, each product carries the legacy of generations of skilled hands. Today, Purbasha continues to support artisans through training, exhibitions, and modern retail platforms.",

                    <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                      Tripura, nestled in the northeast of India, is a land rich
                      in cultural heritage and traditional crafts. Among its
                      many artistic expressions, handloom weaving stands out as
                      a timeless emblem of the state's indigenous identity.
                      Rooted deeply in the customs of the tribal and non-tribal
                      communities of the region, Tripura's handloom sector
                      reflects not only artistic excellence but also a source of
                      livelihood for thousands.

                    <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                      The art of handloom weaving in Tripura has been passed
                      down through generations, especially among the tribal
                      communities such as the Reangs, Lushais, and Tripuris.
                      Each community has developed its unique motifs, patterns,
                      and techniques that are rich in symbolism and tradition.
                      Women, in particular, play a vital role in the weaving
                      process, often using loin looms (also known as backstrap
                      looms) â€” a portable and indigenous type of loom that gives
                      the weaver complete control over the design and weave.

                      rihamp, and kamchwlwi borok, which hold cultural
